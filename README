This is a little script that I wrote to demo live interactive bash sessions.
Run "make install" to install bash-tutor and "make uninstall" to remove.
See the comments in the header of bash-tutor.sh for basic usage.
Some examples are provided in the examples/ subdirectory.
Please be warned that scripts run with bash-tutor actually get executed!
Use at your own risk!
